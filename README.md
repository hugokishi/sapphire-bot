Hello.

Iâ€™m a very useful music bot that can make you play a music with a simple command! I have a lot of good commands that you can have a better experience playing your favorites songs!

Commands:
| Command | Description |
| ------------- |:--------:|
| s!play [music name] | Play the song you want! Use **only** the number to select a music! According to the song title!|
| s!skip | This skip command in the current song |
| s!pause | This command pauses the music being played |
| s!resume | This command removes the music pause |
| s!stop | This command ends the discord party by stopping the music |
